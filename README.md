Projects completed over the course of an intensive 12-week data science bootcamp at Constructor Academy, Zurich 2022

# Project 1 Twitter challenge (shortly before the X rebranding)
This was an exercise in webscraping data from twitter users, performing analysis and visualization on the data. 
For the purposes of obtaining the data, we used an active account on the Twitter API. The code to retrieve data is available here, but the authentication creditinals are not shared. 
Some basic time series trends and sentiment analysis were performed, and displayed in a streamlit app, which can be found here. 

Specifically, we were asked to:

Use the Twitter API to access Twitter data. Find the most frequently used hashtags. Choose 5 famous American celebrities, analyze their twitter usage (e.g. number of tweets, retweets, when tweet during the day, etc.) and compare the results to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.

# Project 2 Auto Machine Learning and Supervised Learning Challenge
This was a challenge to find the best model for an anonamous dataset. 

Specifically, we were asked to:

Supervised Learning Challenge

The dataset we will be using contains two CSV files ‘features’ and ‘target’.

Each row in the ‘features’ belongs to a ‘measurement’ and each column represents a ‘feature’. For each row in the ‘features’ you have a corresponding class label in ‘target’. You can consider the row-numbers as keys.

You will have to use data labelled as ‘train’ for implementing the models. You have to submit the results that you obtain from the predictions of your Machine Learning models from the data labelled as ‘test’.

Complete the following:

Explore your data. Can you identify anything interest that is worth noting from the data?
Define a set of possible classifiers and show which one performs best. Keep in mind the problem of overfitting.
Using feature selection try to reduce the number of features. In the dataset you have over 120 features. Find the good ones for your classifier.
Keep in mind that there is no best solution to the challenge. Show how you approach a problem, and the skills/methods you use in that approach.

Evaluation Process:

The relevant metric in scikit-learn to increase is f1_macro. After you finish your best model, please save your predictions to CSV file with the column names ‘Id’ and ‘Predicted’. No index column!

Submit your CSV file in ‘Submit Predictions’ section.

You can check your score in ‘My Submissions’ section and choose the one to make it Final Score by checking the ‘Use for Final Score’ checkbox.
